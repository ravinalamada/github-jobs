  It is good to have a good name for everything.
## About my projects
  I build github job website with React, Context, Route, Usereducer. I have two folders which are an App folder and Components folder. App folder contains App file that displays the all of the components and the Components folder contains all of the files that are displayed in the App file. In these files, I fetch the data in my useReducer file and then import the state in my contextProvider so that I can access it whatever components I want it to be called.  I have Header file that contains a form which allows user to search job by title, and company name. I have a JobList file that displays the jobs items and the JobDetails which displays Job’s details from its own id.

## What would I improve if I had more time
  Well, there are many that need to be improved in the projects, such refactoring my code by using compound components, making the className better and so on. So, if I had more times, I would do these things in order to make my code cleaner and more explicit.

## What I learned while I was working
  I learn more about how Router and context, useReducer work together.  Moreover, I learnt how to work with multiple APIs in react which I didn’t really know before.

##  The most challenging part for me
  I had a great deal of difficulty in displaying the JObDetails components.
